        <h5>Distance Golf Ball</h5>
        <p>
          These premium distance golf balls feature a higher initial velocity, a
          softer compression compared to the previous model and a penetrating
          ball flight to provide optimum distance with responsive soft feel
          These golf balls are highly resilient with more technology packed into
          their round dimpled frame. With 108 less dimples than the previous
          Srixon distance golf balls, the speed dimples reduce drag and increase
          lift giving you more than you could ever imagine in any wind
          conditions. Created to offer high initial velocity on every shot with
          high launch angle, you can discover greater distance with a more
          responsive lightweight feel. Suitable for high handicap golfers. This
          soft feel golf ball is made with a 2-piece construction to bring you
          the best possible performance on the golf course. The cover design, a
          highly resilient ionomer cover provides longer drives and exceptional
          cut proof durability, while it has a large Energetic Gradient Growth
          core in the centre. The soft compression gives high initial velocity,
          high launch angle and low spin. Super responsive and great carry
          distance along with responsive feel tops off this technology-driven
          golf ball. Srixon Distance are premium distance golf balls and they
          offer higher initial velocity and a penetrating golf ball flight for
          greater distance. A responsive light feel and exceptional durability
          make it ideal for those with a swing speed of 80mph or greater.
